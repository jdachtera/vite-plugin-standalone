# vite-plugin-standalone

A vite plugin, that uses [@vercel/ft](https://github.com/vercel/nft) to create a standalone server build. Using this plugin, no node_modules is required for deployment, only the build folder need to be copied.

Warning: This is an experimental plugin. It may or may not work for you. If it doesn't work, please open an issue, so I can investigate.
